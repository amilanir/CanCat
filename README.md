# CanCat
swiss army knife of Controller Area Networks (CAN) often used in cars and building automation, etc...

made possible through collaboration with my friends at GRIMM (SMFS), most notably Matt Carpenter and Tim Brom.

CanCat is made up of two parts:
1) Firmware for a compatible CAN-transceiver
2) Python client to talk to the tool

it is a lot like the architecture for RfCat, and we may make it moreso.  currently we're sticking with the original design by Matt and team.

currently supported CAN-transceiver combinations:
* Arduino with SeeedStudio's CANBUS Shield
* Arduino DUE with Togglebit.net's CAN shield

possibly future options:
* "Macchina" from RechargeCar.com (they have included cool other toys for talking to other buses)
* Arduino with CANBUS Shield from LinkSprite.com (may already work, just haven't had time to test)


the goals of CanCat are multiple:
* provide a way to capture and transmit messages on an arbitrary CAN bus (whatever the speed, as supported by hardware)
* provide an architecture for analyzing messages and identifying what is what
* provide a manner for data to be shared (Ford sends different messages from GM, Saab, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, etc...)
    this may be in the form of lookup tables
    this may be in the form of accessor code

github collab/pull requests should make this a good point of collaboration.


## Required Software:
* CANBUS_Shield from SeeedStudio  (for Firmware compilation)
    http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/CAN-BUS_Shield
    https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield

* Python 2.7

## Highly Recommended Software:
* IPython

## Installation
1) Install pyserial:
```
$ pip install --user pyserial
```
2) Install ipython (optional, but required for interactive use):
```
$ pip install --user ipython
```
3) Install the [Arduino IDE](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-builder).  If you are using a [Macchina M2](https://www.macchina.cc/) follow the [getting started guide](http://docs.macchina.cc/m2/getting-started/arduino.html) for the M2 to install the M2 hardware definitions in the Arduino tool.

4) (Optional) Install the [arduino-builder](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-builder) for your platform.  The arduino-builder tool can be used to compile and flash your CAN device without opening the Arudino IDE.  NOTE: It has only been tested in Linux so far.

5) Clone CanCat and build the desired firmware.  If not using the arduino-builder tool, use the Arduino IDE as normal to build and flash the sketch onto your target device.  NOTE: You may need to modify the paths in the makefile to suit your environment.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/atlas0fd00m/CanCat
$ cd CanCat/sketches
$ make m2
$ make bootloader
$ make flash
```
6) Unplug and replug in the USB connector to your CAN device (to remove it from bootloader mode)

7) Start CanCat and do a connectivity check.  `c.ping()` confirms that the CanCat python script is communicating properly with the CAN device, `c.getCanMsgCount()` shows that CAN messages are being received by CanCat.
```
$ cd CanCat
$ ./CanCat.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 

In [1]: c.ping()
Out[1]: (1521577490.792667, 'ABCDEFGHIJKL')

In [2]: c.getCanMsgCount()
Out[2]: 1900

In [3]: c.getCanMsgCount()
Out[3]: 2127

In [4]: 
```

## Getting Started:
Once you have the required software installed, your CanCat device flashed, the interface is yours to choose.  currently, we simply enjoy using ipython to interact with the CAN bus and do analysis.
CanCat is currently centered around the class CanInterface (or some subclass of it, like FordInterface, GMInterface, etc...)

connect to the device (old way):

```python
>>> import cancat

>>> CANalysis = cancat.CanInterface('/dev/ttyACM0', 115200) # your device may vary

>>> CANalysis.ping()
```

set the can bus interface baud rate (500kbps is most common, others are often slower, depending on your car):

```python
>>> CANalysis.setCanBaud(cancat.CAN_125KBPS)    # medium speed CAN baudrate for Fords
```

once you connect to the device and set the device, you will automatically capture any messages the CanCat device sees on the CAN bus it is attached to.  it will store these messages for analysis

save your analysis/capture session periodically (only when you say save will it save)

```python
>>> CANalysis.saveSessionToFile('filename_for_this_session')
```

once you save it once, the name will be cached so you can simply save it again to the same file by typing:

```python
>>> CANalysis.saveSessionToFile()
```

other than that, "help" is your friend :)

```python
>>> help(cancat)
```

connect to the device(new way - Linux):

```bash
$ ./CanCat.py -h

$ ./CanCat.py -p /dev/ttyACM0  # if CanCat device is /dev/ttyACM0

$ ./CanCat.py -f filename_of_previous_capture  # no CanCat device required
```

```
'CanCat, the greatest thing since J2534!'

Research Mode: enjoy the raw power of CanCat

currently your environment has an object called "c" for CanCat.  this is how 
you interact with the CanCat tool:
    >>> c.ping()
    >>> c.placeBookmark('')
    >>> c.snapshotCanMsgs()
    >>> c.printSessionStats()
    >>> c.printCanMsgs()
    >>> c.printCanSessions()
    >>> c.CANxmit('message', )
    >>> c.CANreplay()
    >>> c.saveSessionToFile('file_to_save_session_to')
    >>> help(c)
```

(Note: The following two are used interchangeably in our notes:)
(`>>>` is the default interactive python prompt.)
(`In [#]:` is the IPython prompt)

see if the CanCat is communicating correctly with your computer (only if you have a device connected)

```python
In [1]: c.ping()
```

set the can bus interface baud rate (500kbps is most common, others are often slower, depending on your car):

```python
In [2]: c.setCanBaud(cancat.CAN_125KBPS)  # medium speed CAN baudrate for Fords
```

once you connect to the device and set the device, you will automatically capture any messages the CanCat device sees on the CAN bus it is attached to.  it will store these messages for analysis

save your analysis/capture session periodically (only saves when when you tell it to)

```python
In [3]: c.saveSessionToFile('filename_for_this_session')
```

once you save it once, the name will be cached so you can simply save it again to the same file by typing:

```python
In [4]: c.saveSessionToFile()
```

other than that, "help" is your friend :)

```python
In [5]: help(cancat)
```

or tab-completion

```python
In [6]: c.<PRESS_TAB_KEY>
c.CANrecv
c.genCanMsgs
c.ping
c.recv
c.saveSessionToFile
c.CANreplay
c.getArbitrationIds
c.placeCanBookmark
c.recvall
c.setCanBaud
c.CANsniff
c.getBookmarkFromMsgIndex
c.port
c.register_handler
c.setCanBookmarkComment

c.printAsciiStrings
c.remove_handler
c.setCanBookmarkCommentByMsgIndex
c.bookmark_info

c.verbose
c.filterCanMsgs
c.log
c.printSessionStats
c.restoreSession
c.filterCanMsgsByBookmark
c.name
c.printSessionStatsByBookmark
c.saveSession
```

(start with the functions that start with "print" to get familiar with the toolset.

hack fun!

# CAN-In-The-Middle

CAN-In-The-Middle is another way to utilize your CanCat. It requires two CAN shields 
on one arduino. One of the CAN shields needs to be modified so that the CS pin of the 
MCP2515 CAN controller is on D10, rather than D9. This is accomplished by cutting a 
trace on the CAN shield PCB and bridging (solder bridge or 0-ohm resistor) the pads
for CS and D10. Instructions are also on the seeedstudio Wiki, although their board 
differed slightly from mine, mostly in that the pads are on the bottom of the board 
on mine and on the top of the board in their example.

Once you have a properly modified CAN Bus shield, you'll be able to isolate components
connected to the CAN bus to see which messages a specific device is sending, without
changing the conditions by fully removing it from the CAN Bus. This can be very helpful for 
certain reverse engineering tasks.

Flash the CAN_in_the_middle firmware to the Arduino. Hook the CAN wires up so that the 
device you are trying to isolate is connected to the modified CAN shield that uses D10
for CS, and the vehicle CAN bus (with the rest of the devices) is connected to the 
unmodified CAN shield. These are referred to as the Isolation network (ISO)
and the Vehicle network (VEH) respectively.

Start CAN_in_the_middle with the following command:

`./CanCat.py -I CanInTheMiddle -p /dev/tty.usbmodem1411 -S 500K`

where the -p option is your port and -S is the CAN Baud rate

Most of the commands for CanInTheMiddle are the same as the normal CanCat interface. 
Functions that report only what has been received on the Isolation side have Iso appended 
to the end of the function name. For example:

```sh
$ citm.getCanMsgCount() # The number of CAN packets seen in aggregate

$ citm.getCanMsgCountIso() # The number of CAN packets received on the Isolation network

$ citm.printCanMsgs() # Prints all CAN messages

$ citm.printCanMsgsIso() # prints all CAN messages received on the Isolation network
```

Placing a bookmark places a bookmark simultaneously on both the Isolation information and the aggregate information.

Happy Hacking!
